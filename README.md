I grew up in a very small town nicknamed "Ge-nowhere", and a common joke was that there was nothing much to do in the Summer aside from throw walnuts at trees. Since I've moved out to Chicago, I find I miss all the trees quite a bit, so I have themed my game around that half-joke pass time. In the game, the player throws walnuts at some of my favorite trees that I grew up around, in a setting loosely modeled after my childhood home. I like the outdoors, so home to me is defined by the local flora.
